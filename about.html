  <h1>All about my favorite dog breeds</h1>
  <p>Here you will find a list of my favorite
    dog breeds along with some interesting/important information to know about them</p>



  <h2>Dachshund (aka the weiner dog): <i>Loving Loyal Smart</i></h2>
  <p>Dachshunds are definitely the best dog breed out there. They love to go outside
    exploring but also love to cuddle. They truly love being with their owners and will often
    follow you around. These long and lovable creatures come in many colors with
    either long, short, or wired hair.

  <h2>Cocker Spaniel: <i>Gentle Smart Happy</i></h2>
  <p>These gorgeous dogs are perfect for families as they are easily trained and are
    great playmates for kids. They are eager playmates for kids and some of the best
    companions. With their big eyes, long ears, and many coat colors, the Cocker
    spaniel is a great fit for anyone.
